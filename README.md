     The state in the assignment project is managed using the useState hook. The useState hook allows us to create state variables that are local to a component. The hook returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update the state value.

<p>In the assignment project, we are using useState to create  state variables:</p>

- allCourse: This state variable stores an array of all courses.
- selectedCourse: This state variable stores an array of selected courses.
- remaining: This state variable stores the remaining credit hours.
- totalcredit: This state variable stores the total credit hours of selected courses.
